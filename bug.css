The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

The problem is that if the total width of the `.item` elements exceeds the width of the container, some browsers will not correctly space the elements.  Instead of spacing them evenly across the container, some may wrap or overlap.
